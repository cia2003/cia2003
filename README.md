# 👋 Hi, I’m @cia2003
I'm Gracia, a curious college student, majoring in IT and Big Data Analytics. Recently, I'm exploring the world of front-end development to increase my skill and knowledge. I'm always diving into something new.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🎓 Currently studying computer science
- 🎨 Passionate about front-end development, but will found other later
- 📚 Always learning — from new frameworks to weird JavaScript quirks

## 🛠 Tech & Tools I Use
- Tech Stack
  - HTMl / CSS / JS
  - npm + Webpack
- Tools I Like
  - VS Code

## Currently Learning
- 📱 Responsive & mobile-first design
- 📐 BEM Methodology — still exploring how to write scalable, maintainable CSS
- ✨ Animation with Motion
- 🧪 Accessibility and performance optimization

## Fun Facts
- 😴 When I sleep, it often helps me get inspiration or solve tricky code problems
- 🎧 Listening to lo-fi beats helps me focus while coding
- 📒 I usually use a lot of papers to sketch UI ideas and layouts
- 🔍 I often Google the same error message multiple times before the solution clicks
- 🤖 AI tools inspire me when solving coding problems — their solutions usually get me about 60% there, and I enjoy figuring out the rest on my own!
