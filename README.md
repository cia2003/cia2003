# 👋 Hi, I’m @cia2003
I'm Gracia, a curious college student, majoring in IT and Big Data Analytics. I'm always diving into something new.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🎓 Currently studying computer science
- 📚 Always learning — from web design trends to weird JavaScript quirks

## Fun Facts
- 😴 When I sleep, it often helps me get inspiration or solve tricky code problems
- 🎧 Listening to lo-fi beats helps me focus while coding
- 📒 I usually use a lot of papers to sketch UI ideas and layouts
- 🔍 I often Google the same error message multiple times before the solution clicks
- 🤖 AI tools inspire me when solving coding problems — their solutions usually get me about 60% there, and I enjoy figuring out the rest on my own!
